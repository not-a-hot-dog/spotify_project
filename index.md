## Project Overview 
Our project goal is that of automatic playlist generation, where we create models for song discovery by starting with an initial playlist chosen by a user - in some cases, these playlists could contain user/context information that might be relevant in selecting similar playlists. Using the models we have developed, we recommend additional songs for users by suggesting tracks that could be in the playlist based on their similarity to the existing tracks.

## Recommender System Models 
For the purposes of this project, in our test set of playlists, we only feed 70% of all tracks in the playlist as **calibration** for the models, keeping 30% of tracks **withheld** as the ground truth, to test our predictions against. While this might mean that there could be the scenario that our model recommends songs that the playlist user would like but are not covered in the test set, we find that this methodology of measuring success is by far the most objective way of comparing the quality of our recommendations across the models we have developed.

We have created 3 models for our objective: Collaborative Filtering, k-means Clusteringâ€ƒand Naive Bayes Classifier. Details are in each model's individual page.

## Measures of Success
We define a relevant track as a track uri that is in the predicted dataset and the playlist's withheld dataset.

We have identified the three metrics (RPS, NDCG and hit-rate) to evaluate our model. We calculated RPS and NDCG for two different number of recommendations produced by the model, `k` and `7/3` where `k` is the number of songs in a particular playlist withheld from the model. Our choice of using `7/3*k` is because this number represents the number of songs used to calibrate the model to the playlist, based on our 70:30 split of the test set. We also calculated hit-rate for 10 recommendations produced by the model to check how accurate our first 10 recommendations are.

To obtain the final metrics, we compute the mean of the scores across all the playlists in the test set, across different values for number of recommendations.

### Hit Rate
Hit rate is the number of predicted relevant tracks divided by the total number of predicted tracks.

### R-precision
R-precision is the number of predicted relevant tracks divided by the total number of withheld songs in the playlist.

### Normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)
Discounted cumulative gain measures the ranking quality of the recommended tracks, increasing when relevant tracks are placed higher in the list. Since we are not concerned about the order of the tracks in the withheld set we give any relevant track a value of 1.
