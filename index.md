### Goal
Starting with an initial playlist chosen by a user, we recommend additional songs by suggesting tracks that appear in similar playlists.

### Methodolgy
We created 3 models for our objective: Collaborative Filtering, k-means Clusteringâ€ƒand Naive Bayes Classifier. Details are in each model's individual page.

### Measures of Success
We define a relevant track as a track uri that is in the predicted dataset and the playlist's withheld dataset.

We have identified the three metrics (RPS, NDCG and hit-rate) to evaluate our model. We calculated RPS and NDCG for two different number of recommendations produced by the model, `k` and `7/3` where `k` is the number of songs in a particular playlist withheld from the model. Our choice of using `7/3*k` is because this number represents the number of songs used to calibrate the model to the playlist, based on our 70:30 split of the test set. We also calculated hit-rate for 10 recommendations produced by the model to check how accurate our first 10 recommendations are.

To obtain the final metrics, we compute the mean of the scores across all the playlists in the test set, across different values for number of recommendations.

#### Hit Rate
Hit rate is the number of predicted relevant tracks divided by the total number of predicted tracks.

#### R-precision
R-precision is the number of predicted relevant tracks divided by the total number of withheld songs in the playlist.

#### Normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)
Discounted cumulative gain measures the ranking quality of the recommended tracks, increasing when relevant tracks are placed higher in the list. Since we are not concerned about the order of the tracks in the withheld set we give any relevant track a value of 1.
